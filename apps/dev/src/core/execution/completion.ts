 * (claude first) a missing / malformed / schema-invalid `<agent-output>` DOWNGRADES
 * the `done` to `no-sentinel`, so the agent literally cannot terminate "done"
 * without the schema — routing a forgotten schema through the same recovery the
 * forgotten text sentinel already uses. Pure; the `warn` is emitted by the caller.
 *
 * Coexist: for runners WITHOUT native schema support the outcome passes through
 * unchanged, so the text sentinel remains their sole terminal signal. Only a
